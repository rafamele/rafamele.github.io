  <h1>Rafael Ramirez-Melendez</h1>
  <p>Hi! I'm an Associate Professor and Leader of the Music and Machine Learning Lab at the Department of Information and 
    Communication Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona. I obtained my BSc in Mathematics from the National 
    Autonomous University of Mexico, and my MSc and PhD in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Bristol, UK. 
    I studied Classical Violin and Guitar and have played with different music groups in Europe, America and Asia. 
    My research interests include music technology, artificial intelligence, and their application to health and well-being. 
    In particular, I have conducted research on technology-enhanced music learning and on the impact of music in autism, 
    emotional disorders, palliative care, cerebral palsy, stroke, and Parkinsonâ€™s disease. I have published more than 120 
    research articles in peer-reviewed international Journals and Conferences, I'm the author of the book Neurocognitive 
    Music Therapy published by Springer, and acted as guest-editor of several special issues focused on music and 
    artificial intelligence.</p>
